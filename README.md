# Discord AI Bot
This is a basic framework to run OpenAI APIs as a Discord bot

Follow the examples in the `commands` folders to add more commands. The app will automatically deploy the commands to the bot. 

# Contributors
Contributors are welcome. Please keep in mind that this is intended to be a framework and no concrete implementation of a user 
key database or other permanent storage should be implemented here. We'll leave that up to the client-specific implmenters. 
I'm open to suggestions for features but wanted to keep the `chat` command fairly simple.

Check out Issues to see what might be coming soon.
